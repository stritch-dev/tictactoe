## Meandering 'discussion' with AI.
It started out with me trying to improve my Tic Tac Toe code. Then branched to having fun with the AI -- it even obliged me and wrote a Tic Tac Toe implementation in Solidty.

### OpenAi Chat GPT
There are a few potential problems with this code:

The getValidSpace function appears to have a bug. It returns the result of isOccupied(space), which is a boolean, rather than the space itself. This means that a player will not be able to select any unoccupied spaces, as the function will always return true or false.

The getValidSpace function also appears to have an unnecessary recursive call. If the user enters a space that is longer than one character, the function will display the board again and then call itself recursively with the same player and prompt() arguments. However, the function does not use the returned value from the recursive call, so it will always return the original space value, even if it is invalid.

The game function is hard-coded to run five rounds, followed by a turn for X. This means that the game will always end after six turns, even if there is a winner before then.

The const Oh = 'O' line uses a capital O, which may be confusing to read as it looks similar to the number 0.

The const board array is initialized with a "not used" string as its first element, which is unnecessary and potentially confusing.

The code does not include any error handling for invalid input, such as a user entering a non-numeric value for a space or entering a space that is already occupied.

The const isOccupied and const isOpen functions are not used outside of the getValidSpace function, so they could potentially be moved inside that function to reduce the number of global variables.


### Jd L
is string concatenation expensive in javascript like it is in java


### OpenAi Chat GPT
In JavaScript, string concatenation can be expensive, especially when dealing with long strings or when performing a large number of concatenations. This is because strings in JavaScript are immutable, which means that a new string has to be created every time a concatenation is performed.

To mitigate this performance issue, JavaScript provides several techniques for string concatenation, such as using template literals (backticks) or the join() method for arrays. These approaches can be faster than using the + operator or the concat() method for large numbers of concatenations or long strings.

That being said, modern JavaScript engines are highly optimized and can perform string concatenation very efficiently in many cases. So for most use cases, the performance difference between different string concatenation techniques is likely to be negligible.


### Jd L
in javascript if i use a string multiple times should i make it a constant

### OpenAi Chat GPT
If you're using a string multiple times in your code, it's generally a good idea to define it as a constant. By doing so, you can avoid duplicating the string literal throughout your code, which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

Defining a string as a constant also has the benefit of enabling JavaScript engines to optimize your code. When a string is defined as a constant, the engine can store the string in memory and reuse it whenever the constant is referenced in your code. This can potentially improve the performance of your code, especially if you're working with large strings or performing a large number of string operations.

To define a string as a constant in JavaScript, you can use the const keyword, like so:

```
const MY_STRING = "This is a constant string";
Once defined, you can use the constant in your code wherever you need to reference the string.
```


### Jd L
is it worthwhile doing this for "\n"

### OpenAi Chat GPT
It depends on how frequently you're using the newline character (\n) in your code.

If you're using it multiple times in a single file, it may be worth defining it as a constant to avoid duplicating the string literal. This can make your code more concise and easier to read.

However, if you're only using it a few times in your code, it may not be necessary to define it as a constant. The performance gains from reusing a constant string in memory are typically small, and may not justify the extra code required to define and use a constant.

In general, using constants to define commonly used values like strings can help make your code more maintainable and easier to read. However, it's important to balance this with the added complexity of defining and using constants, especially for simple values like \n.

### Jd L
awesome.

### OpenAi Chat GPT
Glad you liked it! Let me know if you have any more questions.

### Jd L
can you convert this to java byte code

### OpenAi Chat GPT
I'm afraid I can't directly convert Solidity code to Java bytecode, as Solidity is a programming language specific to Ethereum smart contracts and Java bytecode is the compiled format of Java programming language.

However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to compile Solidity code into bytecode.

To compile Solidity code into bytecode, you'll need to use a Solidity compiler like solc. There are also Solidity compiler plugins for popular development frameworks like Truffle, which make it easier to manage Solidity contracts and compile them into bytecode.

Once you've compiled your Solidity code into bytecode, you can then deploy it to the Ethereum network using tools like Remix, MyEtherWallet, or Web3j.

As for Java bytecode, you'll need to write Java code and compile it using a Java compiler like javac to generate bytecode. Java bytecode can then be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### OpenAi Chat GPT
There is one error in the code:

In the turn function, the turn(player) call within the if (space == null) condition does not pass the chosenSpace argument, which causes an error when the function is recursively called.
To fix this error, you can update the line to turn(player, null).

Here is the corrected code:

```
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({sigint: true})

const X = 'X'
const Oh = 'O'

/*
	board layout
	1, 2, 3,
	4, 5, 6,
	7, 8, 9
*/

const board = ["not used", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " " ]
const isOccupied = space => board[space] === X || board[space] === Oh
const isOpen = space => !isOccupied(space)

const displayBoard = function (){
  const horizontal = "--|---|--"
	const verticalBar = " | "
  const top = board[1] + verticalBar + board[2] + verticalBar + board[3]
  const middle = board[4] + verticalBar + board[5] + verticalBar + board[6]
  const bottom  = board[7] + verticalBar + board[8] + verticalBar + board[9]

	log( " " )
	log( top )
 	log( horizontal )
	log( middle )
  log( horizontal )
	log( bottom )
}

const placePlayer = function (player, space){
	isOpen(space) && (board[space] = player)
}

const top =                  player => board[1] === player && board[2] === player && board[3] === player
const horizontalMiddle =     player => board[4] === player && board[5] === player && board[6] === player
const bottom =               player  =>  board[7] === player && board[8] === player && board[9] === player
const left =                 player  => board[1] === player && board[4] === player && board[7] === player
const verticalCenter =       player  => board[2] === player && board[5] === player && board[8] === player
const right =                player  => board[3] === player && board[6] === player && board[9] === player
const topLeftToBottomRight = player  => board[1] === player && board[5] === player && board[9] === player
const topRightToBottomLeft = player  => board[3] === player && board[5] === player && board[7] === player

  let win =

		}
	if(isOccupied(space)){
		log("** That space has already been taken. **")
			turn(player, null)
	}
	if(space.length > 1){
		log(`force space = ${space} `)
			log("\n \n ** Please enter a a single digit from
```


### Jd L
what would the problem be?  The code for turn() checks if chosenSpace is null if (space == null){
      space = prompt()
    }

### OpenAi Chat GPT
The issue with the code for turn() is that if chosenSpace is null, it will prompt the user for input using prompt(). However, if the user enters an empty string or any non-numeric input, it will still be assigned to space as a string, which will cause errors later in the function. The code should check for these cases and handle them appropriately, such as by asking the user to enter a valid space again.

### Jd L
good point

### OpenAi Chat GPT
Additionally, there are a few other potential issues in the code:

The turn() function recursively calls itself if an occupied or invalid space is chosen, which could potentially cause a stack overflow if the user keeps choosing invalid spaces.

There is no validation on the player input. It assumes that the user will always enter a valid input, which may not always be the case.

The process.exit(0) call in the isWinner() function may cause unexpected behavior if this code is used as part of a larger program or library.

The pb() function is not used and may be unnecessary.


### Jd L
does this function work as a check against the user input? 
``` 
const validateSpace = space => {
  if(! [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].includes(Number(space))){
    log("\n \n ** You may only enter a number 1-8 **")
      turn(player)
  }
}
```
No, the validateSpace function only checks whether the value of space is a number between 1 and 9, and it logs an error message and calls the turn function with the player argument if space is not a valid value. However, the turn function has already been called and executed at that point, so calling it again inside validateSpace would not have the desired effect.

Instead of calling turn inside validateSpace, you should modify validateSpace to return a boolean value indicating whether space is valid or not, and then use that value in the turn function to decide whether to continue with the turn or ask the player to enter a new space. For example:

```
const validateSpace = space => {
  if (! [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].includes(Number(space))) {
    log("\n \n ** You may only enter a number 1-8 **")
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

const turn = function(player, chosenSpace){
  let space = chosenSpace;
  displayBoard();
  log(`${player}, it's your turn. `);
  if (space == null){
    space = prompt();
  }
  while (!validateSpace(space) || isOccupied(space)){
    if (isOccupied(space)){
      log("** That space has already been taken. **");
    }
    space = prompt();
  }
  placePlayer(player, Number(space));
  if(isWinner(player)) {
    log( `\n! ! !         ! ! !` )
    log( `! ! !  ${player} won  ! ! !` )
    log( `! ! !         ! ! !` )
    displayBoard();
    process.exit(0);
  }
};
```

In this version of turn, the while loop will keep asking the player to enter a valid space until they enter a value that is not occupied and passes the validateSpace check. If the validateSpace check fails, validateSpace logs an error message and returns false, which causes the loop to continue.



### Jd L
in javascrtip will this  
```
if (spaceNotValid(space)){
    space = prompt()
  }
```
do the same thing as this 
```
spaceNotValid(space) && space=prompt()
```

### OpenAi Chat GPT
Yes, both expressions should achieve the same result.

The expression if (spaceNotValid(space)) { space = prompt() } is an if statement that checks if spaceNotValid(space) returns true. If it does, it assigns a new value to space using prompt().

The expression spaceNotValid(space) && space = prompt() is a short-circuit evaluation using the logical AND operator &&. It checks if spaceNotValid(space) returns true. If it does, it executes the second operand, which is space = prompt(). The assignment expression will only be executed if the first operand is true.

Both expressions will reassign a new value to space if spaceNotValid(space) returns true.


### Jd L
will this function insure that space is only 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9?
Yes, the validateSpace function will ensure that the space variable contains only the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If the value of space is not in this range, it will log a message to the console and call the turn function again for the same player to prompt for a valid space.

### Jd L
oh how about this version 
```
const spaceNotValid = space => {
  if(space && ! [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].includes(Number(space))){
    log("\n \n ** You may only enter a number 1-9 **")
  }
}
```

### OpenAi Chat GPT
This version of the function will also check if the input is a number between 1 and 9, but it won't prompt the user to enter a valid input like the previous version.

If you want to prompt the user to enter a valid input when the input is not valid, you could modify the function like this:

```
const spaceNotValid = space => {
  if(!space || ! [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].includes(Number(space))){
    log("\n \n ** You may only enter a number 1-9 **")
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
This version of the function will return true if the input is not valid and prompt the user to enter a valid input. Otherwise, it will return false and continue with the game.




### Jd L
i don't see where the user pompt is
It's possible that the prompt is called in a separate part of the code. Can you share more of the code or context so that I can provide a more accurate answer?

### OpenAi Chat GPT
There are a few problems in the code:

isOccupied function is not defined. It should be replaced with isOpen function in getValidSpace function.
The condition in getValidSpace function is wrong. Instead of return isOcuppied(space) it should be return space because if the space is not occupied it should return the space number entered by the player.
space variable in getValidSpace function should be declared using let instead of const because it is reassigned inside the function.
In getValidSpace function, if the length of space is greater than 1, the prompt should be called again instead of calling getValidSpace recursively.
