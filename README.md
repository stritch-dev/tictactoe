## Just for fun
Recently, I started playing with ChatGPT.  I learned that it can analyze and synthesize code. Since, I'm learning JavaScript, I asked the AI for some insights.
If you would like to know more about how my conversation with th AI the transcript is [here](chatWithAI.md). I found that the AI is useful most useful for questions regarding language syntax, providing code refactors, and spotting potential bugs.  While I didn't use all the ideas that it gave me, the interactions helped me better understand the particular funtionality that I was implementing. I found that it's like an advanced Rubber Duck. Ironically, using the AI, increase my programming self-confidence becuase it sometimes gave wrong answers. I was able to spot them.


## Thanks
Thanks for visiting. Enjoy the game.
